# Command Central 10.x templates

This project provides basic templates and layer definitions for
Command Central 10.1 Stacks feature.

The templates are automatically imported as a library into
[Command Central project](https://github.com/SoftwareAG/sagdevops-cc-server)
when you start Command Central server from it.

You can also import them into any Command Central instance by running:

```bash
sagccant up
```

To use templates, open [Command Central Stacks UI](https://0.0.0.0:8091/cce/web/?entry=stacks#stacks:)
and click + icon to create your first stack.
